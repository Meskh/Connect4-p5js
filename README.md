# 🎮 How It Works
## Board Representation 
	•       A 2D array, board[7][6], holds "E" (empty), "R" (red), or "Y" (yellow).  
	•	Rendering  
	•	The blue board and circles are drawn in drawBoard().  
	•	Hover effect highlights the column under the mouse (mouseHoverColumn()).  
## Gameplay  
	•	On mouseClicked(), if the game isn’t over, your click selects a column; the lowest empty cell fills with the current player’s color.  
	•	fourConnected() scans rows, columns, and both diagonals for four in a row.  
	•	Win & Turn Indicators  
	•	When no winner: it draws the current player’s disc above the board and the text “Your Turn.”  
	•	On win: it shows “! WINNER !” and highlights the winning player’s color.  
## Responsive Canvas  
	•	The board scales to windowHeight/10 per cell.  
	•	windowResized() ensures the canvas and layout adapt to viewport changes.
